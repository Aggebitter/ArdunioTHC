Project Status as of:  10 February 2013

BUILD ENVIRONMENT
=================
This software uses Eclipse with the Arduino plug-in from Jantje (www.baeyens.it)


THC SOFTWARE STATUS
===================
Current software is for Rev A boards and is version "0.e".  This is fully functioning (to the extent its been tested so far) and is for a modified Rev A board.


WINDOWS SOFTWARE STATUS
=======================
Windows functionality is currently limited to data when cutting.  The data is provides is:
 - torch on status (1/0)
 - arc good status (1/0)
 - voltage control on (1/0)
 - torch up signal active (1/0)
 - torch down signal active (1/0)
 - cutting voltage (in analog counts)

The data is dumped about every 1 ms, so it can be used to graph the behavior of the system and help with algorithm development and debugging.


HARDWARE STATUS
===============


Rev B Hardware
--------------
Waiting for boards from fab so I can assemble and test them.


Rev A Hardware
--------------
Worked with some additions/corrections.  This version has been debugging/changed and is working well. (It's what I've been using.)  The following are the changes made to the board:
- Tx/Rx lines from Arduino to opto-isolator were swapped
- opto-isolator was too low speed and wouldn't support serial rates over 38.4K
- forgot the zener on the op-amp input for over voltage protection
- 30 Hz noise on the signal required addition of a single pole Butterworth filter


Prototypes
----------
3 different hardware prototypes have been developed and tested. Based on this, a custom "Rev A" shield/board was produced by OSHPark.com (good board service for hobbyists).
