Project Status as of:  14 July 2013

BUILD ENVIRONMENT
=================
This software uses standard Arduino development environment - Version 1.0.5.


THC SOFTWARE STATUS
===================
Current software is for Rev E-M and Rev E-S boards.  This is fully functioning (to the extent its been tested so far).


WINDOWS SOFTWARE STATUS
=======================
There are some false (?) checksum errors when changing the mode with the Windows app.  The app will allow full control of the THC and also allow voltage data capture for analysis.

The data is dumped about every 1 ms, so it can be used to graph the behavior of the system and help with algorithm development and debugging.


HARDWARE STATUS
===============

Rev E Hardware
--------------
Earlier hardware revisions have been abandonded.

Rev E-Shield hardware is working well.

Rev E-Micro hardware is missing two connections that can be made manually with white wires, or by scrapping off solder mask and putting down a solder bridge in two different places.
